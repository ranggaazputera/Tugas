			<p>Hello, we are <a href="#"><b>FiftyThree.</b></a></p>
			<p>We make stuff. Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.<br>We make what we love.<br>We love what we do.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="why">
			<h3>why</h3>
			<p>Over the years we noticed that software that's designed to help us be creative actually made us less creative. Ideas aren't born in slide decks, documents, or image editors. They begin freeform. On paper. In conversations. As sketches.</p>
			<p>We founded FiftyThree to build tools that work the way we do. Tools for the creative space — the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, we really can't imagine working without them.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="what">
			<h3>what</h3>
			<p>In March 2012, we launched <a href="#"><b>Paper by FiftyThree</b></a>, the simplest and most beautiful way to create on the iPad. Since then, Paper has been downloaded millions of times, and it has won the Apple Design Award, Crunchies Award, AIGA Award, IxDA Award, and Apple's App of the Year.</p>
			<p>In December of 2013, we released <a href="#"><b>Pencil</b></a>. The Verge called it “the best iPad stylus yet”, in part because of the way Pencil seamlessly integrates with Paper.</p>
			<p>We're pleased to have received such a warm welcome, but we still have much work to do. Our ambition is no less than to change the way people create, and we're building world-class teams in NYC and Seattle to take on this challenge. There are many more apps, services, and hardware products to come.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="who">
			<h3>who</h3>
			<p>Great products begin with great people. This is who we strive to be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Well-rounded</b>. We develop products at the intersection of art and science. It's great to have depth, but breadth is essential.</li>
				<li><b>Collaborative</b>. Harmonious products reflect the teams that build them. The ability to work across disciplines and make others better is a must.</li>
				<li><b>Makers</b>. We place a high value on the quality of our products and the process of making them. The joy of making is its own reward. We consistently set a higher bar.</li>
				<li><b>Respectful</b>. Creativity flourishes in open, accepting environments. Respect and kindness towards members of the team and our customers is an absolute requirement.</li>
				<li><b>Experimental</b>. We don't shy away from risks and experimentation. We embrace new thinking and technologies and always consider multiple ways of solving problems.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="detail">
